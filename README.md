# Pandas


Pandas is a fast, powerful, and flexible open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures like Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D) that are ideal for handling structured data. Pandas is widely used in data science, analytics, and machine learning workflows for tasks such as cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing data.

This repository contains my practice problems and solutions using **Pandas**, a popular Python library for data analysis and manipulation. These exercises are designed to build and reinforce practical skills in working with real-world data using Pandas.
